# Ideas for Future Work

## SMB Version Strings

The SMB version strings have defaults that are very old:
- native_os = "Windows 5.1" (Windows XP)
- native_lan_manager = "Windows 2000 LAN Manager"
- server_name = "HOMEUSER-3AF6FE"

Options to consider:
1. Update defaults to something more modern (e.g., Windows 10)
2. Randomize them per connection
3. Make them easier to configure per deployment
